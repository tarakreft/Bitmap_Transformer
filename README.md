# Bitmap_Transformer

You will need npm and node.js to use this Bitmap Transformer.
Clone this repo and install the dependencies with 

```javascript
npm i
```

to use the bitmap I provided and invert the colors, type
```javascript
node main.js
```
into your terminal. A file will be created called out.bmp that has the original bitmap (werk.bmp) with the colors inverted. To use a bitmap of your choice, add it to the project and save it as werk.bmp
